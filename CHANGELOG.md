## Unreleased

- feat: Wire `policy.json` through a `PermissionRequest` hook — `allow`/`deny` answer the worker directly, and anything unmatched defers to `canUseTool` so it still parks for the manager
- feat: Record every permission request and the manager's verdict as JSONL (`SUPERVISOR_PERMISSION_LOG`), so the policy can be grown from decisions actually made instead of guessed
- feat: Read config from XDG paths — `~/.config/claude-supervisor/policy.json` overlays the bundled rules, `~/.local/state/claude-supervisor/permissions.jsonl` holds the log — so editing your own policy never dirties the checkout
- fix: Read the server version from `plugin.json` instead of a hardcoded literal, which drifted a release behind and was invisible to the version check
- chore: Commit the bun lockfile so the server's dependencies install reproducibly

## v0.2.0

- fix: Stop writing the log to a hardcoded prototype path; the file log is now opt-in via SUPERVISOR_LOG and stderr is the default
- docs: Correct the README layout block to the shipped flat plugin layout
- docs: Drop the stale "not yet audited" gap and name the marketplace owner in the install snippet

## v0.1.0

- feat: Add supervisor MCP server that spawns worker sessions and parks their permission prompts for the manager to answer
- feat: Add spawn, workers, answer and drain slash commands for the operator surface
- feat: Add worker-wrangler agent running the routine approval loop on a cheap model
- feat: Add supervising-workers skill documenting when to spawn a worker instead of working in the manager session
- docs: Document the escalation chain, the tool list and the known gaps in the README
